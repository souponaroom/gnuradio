/*! \brief VBLAST decoder.
 * Decodes incoming MxM MIMO data by equalizing the received signals in order
 * to extract the M different transmission signals. For the equalization,
 * you can choose between a zero forcing (key='ZF') and
 * a minimum mean squared error (key='MMSE') scheme. Both schemes require
 * channel state information and MMSE additionally needs SNR information.
 *
 * The CSI and SNR information is transported via stream tags with keys given
 * by input arguments.
 * The CSI must be a 3-dimensional vector with the dimensions vlen, num_inputs, num_inputs.
 * For vlen>1 there is provided a separate channel matrix for each
 * vector element. Set vlen>1 if you use a multicarrier system like OFDM
 * (in this case it would be vlen=number of occupied sub-carriers).
 * To generate a proper CSI tag, use the pmt structure pmt_vector(pmt_vector(pmt_c32vector))).
 * Initially the CSI is set to 1.0 + 0j for all branches and are updated
 * with each incoming CSI. The SNR is initially set to 1.0e6; in this case
 * the MMSE equalizer is equal to the ZF equalizer.
 * The CSI and SNR tags are processed separately and they can therefore arrive
 * at different positions of the stream and occur in different frequencies.
 *
 * For 1x1 and 2x2 MIMO schemes, the equalizer is calculated internally.
 * For MxM schemes with M > 2, the C++ template library Eigen is used
 * for the linear algebra operations.
