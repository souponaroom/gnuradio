     * - Selection Combining, key = 'SC'

     * The output stream is calculated out of a combination of the input streams with knowledge
     * of the channel state information (CSI) and with the algorithm of the selected combining technique.
     * The CSI is transported via stream tags with key='csi'. The combining parameters are initially
     * set to the selection of channel 0 for SC and an equal weighting of all channels for MRC
     * and are updated with each incoming CSI. The items between two tags are referred to as "symbols"
     * in this documentation. The length of a symbol can vary.
     *

     * \param vlen Vector length of the input and output items.
