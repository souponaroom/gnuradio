/*! \brief Decodes an incoming stream after the rules of Alamouti's code.
 *  \ingroup digital
 *
 * The Alamouti decoder works with sequences of length 2, decoding them
 * into a code sequence of length 2.
 * The number of input items is automatically scheduled to a multiple of 2, however,
 * if the input data stream is terminated, the absolute number of input items
 * must be an even number.
 * The Alamouti decoder is a sync block which produces the same amount of
 * output items as there are input items. The code rate is R=1.
 *
 * The CSI is transported via stream tags with key='csi'.
 * Initially the CSI is set to 1.0 + 0j for both branches and are updated
 * with each incoming CSI. Because the Alamouti algorithm works with sequences
 * of length 2, the tags should be set only on samples with even positions.
 * CSI tags on uneven sample positions are not processed until the beginning of
 * the next sequence (in this case one sample delay) begins.
 *
 * There exist different versions of the exact algorithm (changed
 * position of negations). This implementation follows [1] and is therefore
 * consistent with the Alamouti encoding block 'alamouti_encoder_cc'.
