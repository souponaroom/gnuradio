    /*! \brief Estimates a MIMO channel matrix.
     *
     * The block estimates the channel matrix of a MIMO scheme with the help of
     * training sequences. The training sequence for each transmitting antenna
     * equals one subvector/row of the 2-dimensional vector training_sequence.
     * The training sequence should be appended as a pilot to the data at the transmitter.
     * The beginning of the pilot must be tagged at the receiver with the key 'pilot'.
     * This tag can be set from a preceding sync block, for example.
     *
     * This block has N inports and N outports. It estimates the channel matrix which each incoming
     * 'pilot' tag, dumps the pilot symbol of each stream and passes the rest of the data through without
     * changing anything. A tag is set at the beginning of each symbol (= a data sequence between to training sequences)
     * with the key 'csi' that contains the estimated MxN channel matrix.
     *
     * For 1xN and 2xN MIMO schemes, the equalizer is calculated internally. For MxN schemes with M > 2,
     * the C++ template library Eigen is used for the linear algebra operations
     * and is a requirement in this case.
     * The training_length is not bounded above, but the minimum length is M
     * (to avoid an underdetermined equation system).
